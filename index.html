                                    The conversion of these leads into paying clients totally depends upon the ability of each agent. Some agents close 2 to 3 deals in a month but there are agents who can’t even close 1 deal  in 6 months. In most cases 70% of our clients get at least 1 listing in the first 3 months. and if you would like to know an average, like any online leads, the conversion rate can be around 3% to 5%. <br><br>
                                    Lets book a zoom call to show you the exact results that our 400+ clients are getting right now.

                                    In addition to that, We are a marketing agency and we do not sell leads, we sell you as a brand to your potential clients when they see you over a period of time and start trusting and believing in your services that’s when they will work with you. There are many agencies who sell random leads but they are never good as the client never applied to work with you in the first place. So our marketing brands you and then gets you the leads. And that’s why 400+ agents work with us with confidence. And I’ll show you their actual results over the zoom call.

We take them to a landing page to complete a detailed survey to get them qualified and when they submit their details, we immediately email you their details to take the ball forward. As this system uses an AI BASED automated follow up system it guarantees a minimum of 20 listing leads every month.” <br><br>

                                    Also, To be upfront some leads will want to sell, some will be just looking to get a price update. So it will be a mixed bag, all that we need to get are a few golden nuggets who want to sell. And you know that they are all worth $10,000 to $20,000 or even more in commissions. <br><br>

It will just be another unopened email sitting in your inbox which won't be able to show you all the ads, landing pages and REAL LIVE Results of 400+ clients, this will be better explained over a zoom call, hence i suggest if we can actually do a zoom call to explain all his to you. I can guarantee you will learn something new and important for your business. (if they still only want an email then take their email and send them the proposal and get a call back time to circle back on this point)

                                    I understand you might be in a small town but nowadays even if somebody is in a small town they are going to be using social media as a tool. <br><br>

                                    We currently help 400 plus agents and many of them are in small towns and villages where there are five or ten thousand people only. <br><br>

                                    But still they are able to get a decent number of leads when they use their Target locations and run targeted ads in your local farm area. <br><br>

                                    I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to show you results of other small towns like Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and other regional towns too. <br><br>

                                    I am pretty sure the call will be able to show you good results and show you how to utilize social media in your business. <br><br>
